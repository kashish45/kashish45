I am a pre-final year student at ITM University Gurugram, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science. Some of my key skills include - Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Big Data Constructs, Business Intelligence, and Statistics constructs, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python, and C++.

I am an upcoming intern at Fidelity International, Gurugram. I have experience working with Machine Learning and Deep Learning Use-cases and deploy them as Flask and Fast-API applications. I really enjoy working with new technologies and build great things. You can know more about my projects and contributions to my GitHub:

I love to participate in hackathons and have secured 2nd and 3rd positions at various machine learning hackathons. One can always find me sitting in front of my laptop, either coding or acting in front of the mirror or my real life 🕶.
